| **1.5**     | WAP to enter a statement from console and write it to a file and read its content from the same file. | [Solution](./Lab-Codes/1.5.c)|

## Lab Session 2 : Basics of Socket Programming

| **S.No.** | **Problem Statement**            | **Solution File**             |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **2.1**     | Write a simple datagram program to establish client server communication.        | [server](./Lab-Codes/2.1s.c) [client](./Lab-Codes/2.1c.c)|
| **2.2**     | Write a sender and receiver program in C by passing the IP address and the port number of each other through the command line arguments using connection less socket.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up the environment for the lab exercises, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/abhinav9444/CN-Lab.git

2. Navigate to the Lab-Codes directory:

   Copy code from different Laboratory session and execute them on your local machine for implementation.
   ```sh
   cd .\CN-Lab\Lab-Codes\ 
   ```
3. Compile the sender and receiver programs using gcc:
   ```sh
   gcc sender.c -o sender
   gcc receiver.c -o receiver
   ```
4. First, run the receiver program:
   ```
   .\receiver.exe
   ```
5. Open another command prompt (cmd) or PowerShell and run the sender program:
   ```
   .\sender.exe
   ```
