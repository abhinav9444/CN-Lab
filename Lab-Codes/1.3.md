# Finding Your IP Address and Observing Changes

## **Step 1: Check Your Public IP Address**
Your **public IP address** is assigned by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and changes when you switch networks.

### **Method 1: Using a Web Browser**
- Open [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) or [https://www.google.com/search?q=my+ip](https://www.google.com/search?q=my+ip).
- Your **public IP address** will be displayed.

### **Method 2: Using Command Line**
- **Windows (PowerShell or Command Prompt)**  
  ```powershell
  curl ifconfig.me
  ```
- **Linux/macOS (Terminal)**  
  ```bash
  curl ifconfig.me
  ```

## **Step 2: Check Your Private IP Address**
Your **private IP address** is assigned by your router for internal network communication.

### **Windows**
- Open Command Prompt (`Win + R`, then type `cmd` and press Enter).
- Run:
  ```cmd
  ipconfig
  ```
- Look for `IPv4 Address` under your active network adapter.

### **Linux/macOS**
- Open Terminal and run:
  ```bash
  ifconfig
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  ip addr show
  ```
- Find the `inet` value under your active interface.

## **Step 3: Switch Networks and Observe Changes**
1. **Connect to a different Wi-Fi** (e.g., switch from home Wi-Fi to mobile hotspot).
2. **Use a VPN** to see how your public IP changes.
3. **Compare the results** by repeating **Step 1**.
