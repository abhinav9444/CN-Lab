# Running Traceroute for www.kiit.ac.in via Multiple Service Providers

## **Step 1: Run Traceroute Using Different Networks**  

### **On Windows (Tracert Command)**
```cmd
tracert www.kiit.ac.in
```
### **On Linux/macOS (Traceroute Command)**
```bash
traceroute www.kiit.ac.in
```
**Repeat the above command using two different service providers (e.g., Home Wi-Fi vs. Mobile Hotspot).**

## **Step 2: Force Traceroute to Use IPv4**
By default, some networks may resolve the domain to an **IPv6 address**. To force **IPv4**, use the following:

### **Windows**
```cmd
tracert -4 www.kiit.ac.in
```
### **Linux/macOS**
```bash
traceroute -4 www.kiit.ac.in
```

## **Step 3: Observations to Note**
1. **Route Differences**  
   - Compare the number of hops and the IP addresses between different service providers.
   - Look for significant delays or alternative paths.

2. **Private IP Addresses**  
   - If you see IPs in the range **10.x.x.x**, **192.168.x.x**, or **172.16.x.x - 172.31.x.x**, they are private addresses.
   - These are internal routers that do not respond to external requests.

3. **Timeouts (`* * *` in Output)**  
   - Some routers may **not reply to ICMP requests** and appear as `* * *`.
   - These are often firewalls or private network nodes.

4. **IPv6 Defaulting Issue**  
   - If the default traceroute shows `2001:xxxx:xxxx::` addresses, it is using IPv6.
   - Use `tracert -4` (Windows) or `traceroute -4` (Linux/macOS) to force IPv4.

These steps will help analyze the network paths for `www.kiit.ac.in` and identify variations across service providers.
