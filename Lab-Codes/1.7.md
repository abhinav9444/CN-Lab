# Displaying Statistics for All Protocols Using Netstat

## **Windows Command**
To display network statistics for all protocols on Windows, use:
```cmd
netstat -s
```
This command provides detailed statistics for TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IP protocols.

## **Linux/macOS Command**
To achieve the same on Linux/macOS, use:
```bash
netstat -s
```
This command gives a summary of statistics for different network protocols, including TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IPv4/IPv6.

## **Example Output (Linux)**
```

    123456 total packets received
    789 out of order packets dropped
    23456 incoming packets discarded
    45678 outgoing packets sent

    654 passive connection openings
    321 failed connection attempts
Udp:
